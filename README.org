* ob-pascal.el

=org-bable= pascal evaluation module.

* Installation
Copy the file to your org folder where the other ~ob-LANG.el~
(LANG=C,python,etc.) files are (and I guess you should byte compile it
too).  Then in you're ~.emacs~ file (or init file of choice) add
~(pascal . t)~ to the ~org-bable-load-languages~ list.

* Development notes
This file is made from ~ob-java.el~ and ~ob-C.el~.
